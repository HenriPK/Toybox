# Toyvox

An unique voxel engine based on raytracing. It has a very powerful way of messing with the models, treating them the same way that 2d raster (pixel) images are treated in Photoshop or Construct3. It doesn't use meshes to render, just a pure voxel algorithm.

Currently, Toyvox is in an experimentation phase.
